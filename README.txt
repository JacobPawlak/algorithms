How to compile: in the terminal, type in g++ -o FizzBuzz fizzBuzz.cpp
(If you want to name it FizzBuzz)

To run the program: in the terminal type, ./FizzBuzz
(or whatever you name it with the -o option in g++)

Number of Fizz: 33 (floor(100/3))

Number of Buzz: 20 (floor(100/5))

Number of FizzBuzz: 6 (floor(100/5))

Bonus: You can subtract all of the Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz from 100
(100 - (floor(100/3) + floor(100/5) + floor(100/15))
